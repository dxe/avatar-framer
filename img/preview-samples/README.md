# `preview-samples` directory

When adding a new frame, if you don't have a preview image provided, you can
add the frame, build and run the app, upload an image from `img/preview-samples`,
and take a screenshot (download button doesn't work) and put the screenshot in
the `previews` folder and build/run again to verify.
